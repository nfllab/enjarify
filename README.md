An experimental rewrite of Enjarify in Rust for performance. Warning: it will probably not be maintained or kept in sync with the Python version.

To build it, switch to the enjarify-rs directory and run `cargo build --release`.

Note that this version currently creates incorrect output (see test8) and the owner of this repository already switched to other engagements.
